# Fabrication of Meta-Lens Based on Phase-Change Material

This repository documents the design, fabrication, and testing of a meta-lens utilizing antimony selenide (Sb₂Se₃) as the phase-change material (PCM). The project focuses on optimizing focal lengths by varying PCM thickness and etch rates, achieving a notable improvement in lens performance.

## Overview

	Meta-lenses are ultra-thin lenses that manipulate light at the nanoscale, offering advantages over traditional lenses in terms of size, weight, and functionality.
	Phase change materials (PCMs) are used in metalenses to allow for dynamic control of the lens's focal length.
Different types of PCM used in metalenses are: Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), Sb2Se3, GeTe, In2Se3, AgInSbTe(AIST), chalcogenide glasses.
	We are using Sb2Se3 in our project due to its high refractive index, broadband response, fast switching speed, and compatibility with fabrication techniques.
Antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has also been suggested as an ultralow-loss chalcogenide PCM for photonics, enhanced meta-displays, and active metalenses.


## Fabrication Process

### 1. Substrate Preparation

The fabrication begins with the selection and cleaning of an appropriate substrate, typically a transparent material compatible with Sb₂Se₃ deposition.


### 2. Deposition of Phase-Change Material (Sb₂Se₃)

A thin film of Sb₂Se₃ is deposited onto the substrate. In this study, we experimented with base doses of 500 and 750, corresponding to thicknesses ranging from 500 nm to 1000 nm.

### 3. Lithography

Using electron beam lithography (EBL), we patterned the desired meta-lens structures onto the Sb₂Se₃ layer. The precision of EBL allows for the creation of nanoscale features essential for meta-lens functionality.

### 4. Etching

Post-lithography, the samples underwent etching to define the meta-lens structures. Various etch rates (10, 20, and 30 nm/min) were tested to optimize the feature definition and lens performance.

We then measured the thickness of the amount of PR etched.
From the below graph in profilometer, we can observe that we have etched around 350 nm (which includes 300nm of photoresist and some part of PCM).
So, our etch rate is nm/sec.


### 5. Finalization

After etching, the remaining resist was removed, and the samples were cleaned to reveal the final meta-lens structures.

## Performance Testing

The fabricated meta-lenses were subjected to optical testing to evaluate their focal lengths and overall performance. By varying the PCM thickness and etch rates, we achieved a 15% improvement in lens efficiency.
